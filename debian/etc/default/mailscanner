# MailScanner configuration file
# by default the file /etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf is used to pull
# various settings for the daemon and permissions for working directories. 
# You may set a different custom file here.
#
# Example: /etc/MailScanner/conf.d/my.conf
#
# Important: to ensure correct permissions are set automatically when
# the MailScanner daemon starts, make sure that these items are included:
#
#	Incoming Work User
#	Incoming Work Group
#	Incoming Work Dir
#	Incoming Work Permissions
#
# ms_conf=/etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf

# RAMDISK Management
# If you are using a ramdisk, this will sync the "Incoming Work Dir"
# (which is where your ramdisk should be mounted if anywhere)
# to a saved state directory upon stopping the MailScanner service 
# and then restore it when the MailScanner service starts again.
#ramdisk_sync=1

# RAMDISK Persistent Store
# The location to store and retrieve the ramdisk contents during
# normal startup and shutdown of the MailScanner process or server.
# This is ignored if you are not using a ramdisk for the 
# "Incoming Work Dir" setting. 
#ramdisk_store=/var/spool/MailScanner/ramdisk_store

#
# This sets how many days files will remain in the "quarantine" area before
# being automatically removed.
#
q_days=30

#
# This sets how much the priority of the mailscanner daemon should be
# reduced by (i.e. "nice -X").  Since it is a batch oriented task,
# there it can easily give up some CPU cycles to more interactive
# tasks. On a system with the main-task to scan mails set this to 0.
