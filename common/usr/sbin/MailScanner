************************************************************************
In MailScanner.conf, your "%org-name%" or "Mail Header" setting
contains spaces and/or other illegal characters.

Including any spaces will break all your mail system (but do not worry,
MailScanner will fix this for you on the fly).

Otherwise, it should only contain characters from the set a-z, A-Z,
0-9, "-" and "_". While theoretically some other characters are allowed,
some commercial mail systems fail to handle them correctly.

This is clearly noted in the MailScanner.conf file, immediately above
the %org-name% setting. Please read the documentation!
