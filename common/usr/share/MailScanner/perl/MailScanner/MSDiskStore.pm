# Stefan Baltus, October 2003
#
# This package opens the body message. Multiple instances of this 
# packges can exist at the same time on the same file. If this file
# is already open and locked in the same process, the lock will be
# released when the file is re-opened and consequently closed.
#
# (from man fcntl in solaris 9):
#
#     All locks associated with a file for  a  given  process  are
#     removed  when  a  file descriptor for that file is closed by
#     that process or the process  holding  that  file  descriptor
#     terminates.  Locks  are  not  inherited  by  a child process
#     created using fork(2).
#
# These semantics don't seem to hold for various other systems, like
# BSD and Linux, so the original code works fine.
#
# This package is changed in such a way that you need an open file-
# descriptor to the file you have probably already open (and locked).

# Returns () if it fails
