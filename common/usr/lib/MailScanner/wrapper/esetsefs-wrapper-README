ESETS EFS requires root to scan

Add to sudoers:

postfix ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/eset/efs/bin/odscan
postfix ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/eset/efs/bin/lslog

where /opt/eset/efs/bin/ is the real path to your esets scan binary
and postfix is the real Run As user for MailScanner

If you have difficulties with the wrapper in your locale change
the date format variables in the esetsefs-wrapper at the top.
Currently EFS works in US and DE locales, additional locale
support can be added by request since this requires localized
code changes (EFS log output gets localized along with actions).

Also, as another helpful note, you have to disable realtime scanning
after installing EFS via the web ui or else it will rip out files
before they have a chance to be scanned
