With sufficient permissions tweaking, it should be possible to get esets to
respond without sudo privileges.  This is the most secure method.

However, if you are still having trouble...

Add the following line to sudoers for esets wrapper:

postfix ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/eset/esets/sbin/esets_scan

where /opt/eset/esets/sbin/ is the real path to your esets scan binary
and postfix is the real Run As user for MailScanner

Edit the esets-wrapper, and follow the instructions therein to enable sudo
