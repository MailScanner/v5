## Cron Job Actions

# MailScanner cron jobs are executed like this:
#
# hourly items: /usr/sbin/ms-cron HOURLY
# daily items:  /usr/sbin/ms-cron DAILY
# daemon check: /usr/sbin/ms-cron CHECK
# maintenance:  /usr/sbin/ms-cron MAINT
#
# The parameters passed (HOURLY, DAILY, etc.) are case insensitive.
#
# You can of course create your own custom cron jobs. These are built
# in for convenience using the options specified below.

# Quarantine Retention
#
# This sets how many days files will remain in the "quarantine" area before
# being automatically removed. Set to 0 (zero) to disable. 
#
# This is executed during the MAINT cron option. 
#
q_days=30

# Update Virus Scanner sigs
#
# Update the virus scanner definitions. Most virus scanners update themselves 
# these days so this is off by default.
#
# This is executed during the DAILY cron option.  0 = off, 1 = on
#
ms_cron_av=0

# Update SpamAssassin sigs
#
# Update the SpamAssassin signatures. This will also compile the rules if the Rule2XSBody plugin 
# is enabled and /usr/bin/re2c is installed. This is enabled by default.
#
# This is executed during the DAILY cron option.  0 = off, 1 = on
#

# was not manually stopped via the init script. 
#
# This is executed during the HOURLY cron option.  0 = off, 1 = on
#
ms_cron_check=1

# MailScanner Problem Message Alert
#
# Check the process attempts database to see if there are any emails 
# MailScanner is having trouble processing. If there are, an email will
# be sent to the address specified in MailScanner.conf "Notices To". This
# is off by default. 
#
# This is executed during the HOURLY cron option.  0 = off, 1 = on
#
ms_cron_msg_alert=0


## RAMDISK Management

# Ramdisk Sync
#
# If you are using a ramdisk, this will sync the "Incoming Work Dir"
# (which is where your ramdisk should be mounted if anywhere)
# to a saved state directory upon stopping the MailScanner service 
# and then restore it when the MailScanner service starts again.
# 0 = off, 1 = on
ramdisk_sync=0

# The MailScanner RAMDISK Persistent Store
#
# The location to store and retrieve the ramdisk contents during
# normal startup and shutdown of the MailScanner process or server.
# This is ignored if you are not using a ramdisk for the 
# "Incoming Work Dir" setting.
