# NOTE: Fields are separated by TAB characters --- Important!
#
# Syntax is allow/deny/deny+delete/rename/rename to replacement-text/email-addresses,
#           then regular expression,
#           then log text,
#           then user report text.
#
# The "email-addresses" can be a space or comma-separated list of email
# addresses. If the rule hits, the message will be sent to these address(es)
# instead of the original recipients.

# If a rule is a "rename" rule, then the attachment filename will be renamed
# according to the "Default Rename Pattern" setting in MailScanner.conf.
# If a rule is a "rename" rule and the "to replacement-text" is supplied, then
# the text matched by the regular expression in the 2nd field of the line
# will be replaced with the "replacement-text" string.
# For example, the rule
# rename to .ppt	\.pps$	Renamed .pps to .ppt	Renamed .pps to .ppt
# will find all filenames ending in ".pps" and rename them so they end in
# ".ppt" instead.

# Due to a bug in Outlook Express, you can make the 2nd from last extension
# be what is used to run the file. So very long filenames must be denied,
# regardless of the final extension.
