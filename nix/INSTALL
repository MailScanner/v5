The install for NIX* is very straightforward. It simply copies the files into place. From
there you will need to create the links to get MailScanner to start at boot. 

Requirements: perl, perldoc, curl, and network access if you want to install missing Perl modules
via CPAN. 

Important files to note:

/etc/MailScanner/defaults

This file contains the system level settings for MailScanner. You will need to edit this file
and at a minimum set run_mailscanner=1 for the daemon to start.


/etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf

The main configuration file for MailScanner's engine. You will also need to customize this file.


/var/lib/MailScanner/init/ms-init

This is the initialization script for MailScanner. This is the script you would symlink to control
MailScanner using start/stop/restart/reload/kill. 


/usr/sbin/ms-perl-check

This executable will tell you what Perl modules you are missing, if any. 


/usr/sbin/ms-*

Many MailScanner executables. Most are self explanatory from the name alone.
