The install for NIX* is very straightforward. It simply copies the files into place. From
there you will need to create the links to get MailScanner to start at boot, etc.

Requirements: perl, perldoc, curl, wget, cpan, sudo, tar, essential perl build tools such as 
make, and network access, if you want to install modules from CPAN.

If you are using RHEL derivatives, Debian derivatives (including Ubuntu), or openSUSE
derivatives, use the appropriate package and not this method from tarball for a greater
chance of success.

Important files to note:

/etc/MailScanner/defaults

This file contains the system level settings for MailScanner. You will need to edit this file
and at a minimum set run_mailscanner=1 for the daemon to start.


/etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf

The main configuration file for MailScanner's engine. You will also need to customize this file.


/usr/lib/MailScanner/init/ms-init

This is the initialization script for MailScanner. This is the script you would symlink to control
MailScanner using start/stop/restart/reload/kill on sysv init-based systems

/usr/lib/MailScanner/systemd/ms-*
These are the systemd unit files that can be used on systemd systems

/usr/sbin/ms-perl-check

This executable will tell you what Perl modules you are missing, if any. 


/usr/sbin/ms-*

Many MailScanner executables. Most are self explanatory from the name alone.
